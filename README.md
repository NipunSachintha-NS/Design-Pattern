# Design Pattern
A design pattern is a reusable solution to common software design problems. It's a template that can be applied in various situations, helping developers create flexible, maintainable, and scalable systems.

# Singleton Design Pattern 
This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It’s used when you need to control access to resources, such as a database connection or a configuration file.

# Adapter Design Pattern 
The Adapter pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two classes by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

# Strategy Design Pattern
This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. It’s useful when a class has multiple behaviors, which can be selected at runtime.
